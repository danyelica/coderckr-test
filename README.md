# Coderockr Test Project

The Front End Test Project was made with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) using the react template.


## Installation
Follow these steps in your terminal to install and run the application:<br>
``$ cd .\coderockr-challenge\``<br>
``$ npm install``<br>
``$ npm run dev``

## Libraries
- It was made using **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** because it is a modern library that helps with a lot of rendering and interactive apps.
- The building tool **[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)** was the chosen one because it has a clean default project.
- It used **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)** for consuming the API because is a more standard library with greater compatibility, instead of the *fecth* method.
